## VII. Risk Mitigation (Draco Review)

### Reputational Risks
- **Public misinterpretation of philosophical claims**
  *Mitigation:* Clear "interpretive, not canonical" labeling. Pinned clarification comments.

- **Conflation with unrelated spiritual/New Age movements**
  *Mitigation:* Structural language, systems thinking framing. Avoid mystical terminology.

- **Patron expectation mismatch (benefits not delivered)**
  *Mitigation:* Underpromise, overdeliver. Monthly check-ins. Transparent communication.

### Platform Risks
- **YouTube algorithm changes reducing visibility**
  *Mitigation:* Diversify platforms. Build email list. Patreon as direct channel.

- **Social media account suspension/moderation**
  *Mitigation:* Backup contact lists. Multi-platform presence. Website as home base.
