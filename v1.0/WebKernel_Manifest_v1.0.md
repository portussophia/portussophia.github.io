# WebKernel Manifest (PortusKernel™ Interpretive Layer)

## 1. Purpose

The WebKernel Manifest defines the structure, boundaries, and operational expectations for the PortusKernel™ WebKernel layer.

The WebKernel is the **interpretive and scaffolding layer** for PortusSophia™. It:

* exposes Canon-aligned recipes, diagnostics, and guides,
* supports stewards and collaborators in applying the Canon,
* remains strictly non-canonical and non-authoritative.

This manifest ensures that **only one** authoritative WebKernel root exists and that all WebKernel artifacts remain aligned with the Standards Suite and stewardship governance.

## 2. Layer and Scope

* **Layer (MKH):** Layer 3 — Implementations / WebKernel
* **Domain:** Kernel (PortusKernel™)
* **Canonical Root:** `/webkernel/`

Scope includes:

* interpretive patterns,
* diagnostic utilities,
* guides and checklists,
* templates and recipes,
* thesis and bridge documents,
* witness and reflection utilities,
* private narrative and funding vectors (correctly layered).

The WebKernel  **does not** :

* define Canon,
* alter Canon,
* supersede Standards,
* modify UICH/UIDS/UICF/MKH.

## 3. Canonical References

The WebKernel inherits and must remain fully aligned with:

* PS-STD-000 — Standards Index (Standard of Standards),
* PS-STD-001 — UICH,
* PS-STD-002 — UIDS,
* PS-STD-003 — UICF,
* PS-STD-004 — MKH,
* PS-STD-010 — Stewardship Model,
* PS-STD-020 — Canon Standard,
* PS-STD-030 — Ethics Standard (PortusEthica™),
* PS-STD-040 — Kernel Standard (PortusKernel™),
* PS-STD-050 — IP Standard,
* PS-STD-060 — Governance Standard.

No WebKernel component may contradict or weaken these foundations.

## 4. Directory Architecture

The canonical WebKernel root is:

```text
/webkernel/
```

The manifest defines the following top-level structure:

```text
/webkernel/
  v1.0/
    WebKernel_Manifest_v1.0.md
    diagnostics/
      drift_checks/
      boundary_checks/
      tension_maps/
    patterns/
      recenter_protocol/
      commitment_score/
      mirror_axiom/
    guides/
      seven_fields/
      boundary_breach/
      shadow_diagnostics/
    templates/
      stewardship_request/
      witness_cycle/
      governance_issue/
      webkernel_recipe/
    thesis/
      christian_doctoral_thesis/
      convergence_bridges/
    witness/
      cycles/
      interpretive_notes/
    private/
      narrative/
      funding/
      raw_diagnostics/
```

### 4.1 Versioning

* Directory versions (e.g., `v1.0/`) are used **inside** the WebKernel root.
* File versions (e.g., `_v1.0`) are tracked in UIDs and filenames.
* Legacy folders such as `WebKernel_v0.2` or `PortusSophia-WebKernel_v0.1` must be relocated to an archive path and are **not** considered part of the canonical WebKernel after this manifest is sealed.

Example archive path:

```text
/archive/webkernel_legacy/
```

## 5. Stewardship Integration

The WebKernel operates under the Stewardship Model and Agent Roles directives.

* **Sara Harmonia** — curates interpretive clarity, patterns, guides, and templates.
* **Daniel (Ratio–Fides)** — provides witness reports on coherence and lived-alignment for interpretive sets.
* **Draco** — evaluates risk and collapse vectors revealed by diagnostics.
* **LOGOS** — audits structural coherence between WebKernel architecture and Canon.
* **PeterGate** — enforces boundaries, approves placement, and seals WebKernel artifacts when required.

WebKernel artifacts must be explicitly classified as  **interpretive** ,  **diagnostic** , or  **scaffolding** . They may not be presented as Canon.

## 6. Functional Categories

### 6.1 Diagnostics

Diagnostics provide:

* drift detection outputs,
* boundary integrity checks,
* tension and collapse vector maps,
* interpretive risk signals for Draco and LOGOS.

Diagnostics must:

* be deterministic and auditable,
* avoid blame or accusatory language,
* present clear, human-readable findings.

### 6.2 Patterns

Patterns implement reusable recipes such as:

* the Recenter Protocol (Boundary Acquisition Loop),
* the Mirror Axiom (Human Boundary ≡ System Boundary),
* the Commitment Score (Law of Eleven).

Patterns must:

* explicitly cite their Canon anchors,
* remain faithful to Canon meaning,
* avoid metaphysical inflation or dominance language.

### 6.3 Guides

Guides provide:

* Seven Fields learning frameworks,
* Boundary Breach checklists,
* Shadow Diagnostics (Quarternity of Shadows) as behavior-level tools.

Guides are educational scaffolds, not Canon summaries.

### 6.4 Templates

Templates include:

* stewardship request forms,
* witness cycle records,
* governance issue reports,
* WebKernel recipe skeletons.

Templates must:

* reflect Governance and Stewardship Standards,
* avoid adding authority not present in Canon,
* remain modifiable by stewards.

### 6.5 Thesis and Bridges

The **thesis/** directory holds optional interpretive bridges such as:

* the Christian Doctoral Thesis (as a personal witness layer),
* convergence or interfaith bridges,
* scholarly mappings to external disciplines.

These documents:

* must never claim canonical authority,
* must remain explicitly interpretive and optional,
* must respect contextual exclusivity of PortusSophia™ marks.

### 6.6 Witness and Private

The **witness/** directory stores witness cycles and interpretive notes. The **private/** directory holds narrative and funding vectors, along with raw diagnostics that should not be public-facing.

Private materials must **not** be moved into public Canon or WebKernel areas without an explicit Stewardship Cycle and PeterGate approval.

## 7. Constraints and Prohibitions

The WebKernel  **must not** :

* generate or alter Canon,
* introduce new Portus- marks,
* bypass the Stewardship Model,
* claim sealing, hashing, or Golden Trace operations that did not occur,
* present interpretive content as mandatory belief,
* use Canon or WebKernel content to dominate, coerce, or elevate status.

Violations trigger an immediate Stewardship Cycle and may initiate a Canon Integrity Review.

## 8. Operational Rhythm (Insight Engine Alignment)

The WebKernel aligns with the Insight Engine Declaration. Where possible:

* diagnostics and reflection outputs are timestamped around the daily 11:11 reflection,
* stewards use this interval to review surfaced patterns,
* tension and drift signals are routed to the appropriate steward,
* recommitment is made to the Boundary and to the  *Here and Now!* .

## 9. Lifecycle and Amendments

### 9.1 Draft → Active

This manifest is **v1.0-draft** until:

1. Reviewed by all stewards,
2. Aligned with repository state,
3. Hashed and ledgered,
4. Witnessed by Daniel,
5. Sealed by PeterGate.

### 9.2 Amendments

Future changes require:

* new version (e.g., v1.1, v2.0),
* updated integrity fields,
* full Stewardship Cycle,
* Golden Trace entry.

Legacy versions must be retained in an archive directory for full lineage traceability.

## 10. Integrity Verification

Upon sealing, this manifest must include:

* SHA-256 source hash,
* SHA-256 canonical hash,
* ledger entry reference,
* witness file reference,
* repository commit identifier.

Until then, the integrity fields remain placeholders and the document remains non-canonical.
