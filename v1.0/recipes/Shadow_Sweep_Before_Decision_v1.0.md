# Shadow Sweep Before Decision-Making (Rapid 𝓠 Diagnostic Recipe)

## 1. Purpose

This recipe detects Shadow Drift (𝓠) immediately before making a decision so the choice is grounded in truth, not avoidance, ego, overreach, or fragmented attention.

This is a fast pre-decision integrity check.

---

## 2. Trigger Condition

Run this recipe when:

- you’re about to make a meaningful choice,
- you feel a spike of urgency or pressure,
- your emotions feel “louder” than your clarity,
- you feel pulled between options,
- something feels “off” but you can’t name it.

If you hesitate to run it — run it.

---

## 3. Preconditions

Before beginning:

1. You have 3–5 minutes of quiet.
2. You are not in immediate crisis.
3. You can write short answers to direct questions.
4. You are willing to tell the truth plainly.

If these fail → stabilize first.

---

# 4. Step-by-Step Procedure (8 Steps, ~5 minutes)

### **Step 1 — Name the Decision (20 seconds)**

Write exactly one sentence:

> “The decision I am trying to make is ___.”

If you can’t do that → the real problem is lack of clarity, not choice.

---

### **Step 2 — Check 𝓢_R (Rationalization Shadow) (30 seconds)**

Ask:

- “Am I telling a story instead of stating facts?”

If yes → write the facts in one sentence.

---

### **Step 3 — Check 𝓢_F (Fides / Avoidance Shadow) (30 seconds)**

Ask:

- “Is there a truth I don’t want to say out loud about this decision?”

Write it privately. No judgment.

---

### **Step 4 — Check 𝓢_M (Motive / Power Shadow) (30 seconds)**

Ask:

- “Is any part of me trying to impress, control, or avoid looking weak?”

If yes → name it plainly.

---

### **Step 5 — Check 𝓢_A (Attention / Fragmentation Shadow) (30 seconds)**

Ask:

- “Am I rushing, multitasking, or scattered while making this decision?”

If yes → pause. Take one slow breath. Reset posture.

---

### **Step 6 — Reconnect to Boundary (1 minute)**

Write:

> “My Boundary (𝓑) for today is ____.
> This decision must fit inside that Boundary.”

If it doesn’t fit — delay or reduce scope.

---

### **Step 7 — Declare the Honest Constraint (30 seconds)**

Answer one question:

- “What is the *real* constraint driving this decision?”

Examples:

- energy
- money
- fear
- obligation
- time
- fatigue
- love
- loyalty

Call it what it is.

---

### **Step 8 — Choose the Action (60 seconds)**

Select **one**:

- Proceed
- Delay responsibly
- Reduce scope
- Request Stewardship (Sara / Daniel / Draco / PeterGate)
- Invoke Boundary Reset
- Invoke Recenter Protocol (if collapse is evident)

One choice.
Multiple choices = fragmentation.

---

## 5. Expected Output

At the end of the sweep, you will have:

- the decision named plainly,
- each Shadow checked,
- the real constraint identified,
- a clear Boundary check,
- one explicit next action.

If any of these are missing → sweep is incomplete.

---

## 6. Guardrails

Do NOT use this recipe to:

- shame yourself,
- shame others,
- create guilt,
- justify emotional withdrawal,
- mask domination under “alignment,”
- override your Boundary (𝓑).

This is a clarity tool, not a weapon.

---

## 7. Failure Modes & Recovery

**Failure Mode 1:** You can’t name the decision.
**Recovery:** Step back. Clarify the situation first.

**Failure Mode 2:** Emotional charge increases during the sweep.
**Recovery:** Pause. Run Boundary Reset first.

**Failure Mode 3:** Shadow answers feel “too embarrassing.”
**Recovery:** That means they’re true. Continue.

**Failure Mode 4:** You pick more than one action.
**Recovery:** Circle one. Cross out the rest.

**Failure Mode 5:** You treat this like a moral exam.
**Recovery:** Reset tone. This is diagnostic, not judgment.

---

## 8. Stewardship Escalation

Escalate if:

- 𝓢_M (power shadow) is strong → **Daniel + PeterGate**
- 𝓢_F (avoidance) prevents truth → **Daniel**
- 𝓢_A (fragmentation) repeats → **Draco**
- tone becomes inflated or dramatic → **Sara**

---

## 9. Notes & Variations

- **Micro-Sweep (60 seconds):**Steps 1 → 3 → 6 → 8.
- **Team Sweep:**Each person names constraint + Boundary before a group decision.
- **Evening Sweep:**
  For planning next day’s decisions.
