# Meta-Recipe: How to Build a Correct WebKernel Recipe

## 1. Purpose

This meta-recipe defines the **one correct method** for creating WebKernel recipes — short operational playbooks that help people apply PortusSophia™ principles responsibly, consistently, and without tone or boundary drift.

It ensures every recipe:

- uses the same structure,
- avoids inflated or metaphysical language,
- honors PortusEthica™,
- maintains MKH Layer-3 placement,
- and follows a predictable, steward-friendly rhythm.

This recipe must be followed before any new recipe is authored.

---

# 2. Trigger Condition

Use this meta-recipe whenever:

- writing a new WebKernel recipe,
- modifying or refactoring an existing recipe,
- converting a loose idea into a repeatable playbook,
- onboarding collaborators to build their own recipes.

If you don’t follow this, the recipe risks drift, ego-shaping, or tone inflation.
That breaks the system. Don’t do that.

---

# 3. Preconditions

Before creating a recipe:

1. You know **why** the recipe is needed.
2. You can express its purpose in **one sentence**.
3. You can contain it within **10 steps or fewer**.
4. You have read the relevant patterns (Recenter, Mirror Axiom, Law of Eleven).
5. You can maintain presence *Here and Now!* without dramatizing the problem.

If any of these fail → pause and Recenter.

---

# 4. Step-by-Step Procedure (How to Build a Recipe)

### **Step 1 — Name the Recipe Cleanly**

Use a simple operational name:

- “Boundary Reset in 15 Minutes”
- “Shadow Sweep Before Decision-Making”
- “Two-Minute Tone Calibration”

Avoid mystical, metaphysical, or inflated names.

---

### **Step 2 — Define the Purpose (1 sentence)**

Write **exactly one sentence** describing what the recipe does.
If you need two sentences, the scope is too big — shrink it.

Example:

> “This recipe stabilizes Boundary (𝓑) during early signs of overwhelm.”

---

### **Step 3 — Set the Trigger Condition**

Describe the exact circumstance where the recipe applies.

Examples:

- “When friction spikes unexpectedly,”
- “Before making a financial decision,”
- “After a Stewardship disagreement.”

This prevents misuse.

---

### **Step 4 — Write Preconditions**

State what must already be true before someone runs the recipe.

Examples:

- “You are not actively overwhelmed.”
- “You have at least 5 minutes.”
- “You have the relevant artifact open.”

This keeps people safe.

---

### **Step 5 — Write the Steps (≤ 10 steps, imperative voice)**

Rules for steps:

- Start each with a **verb**
- Make each step concrete
- No metaphysical claims
- No “interpretation” steps — only **actions**

Bad:

> “Connect to higher resonance.”

Good:

> “Write the problem in one sentence.”

Bad:

> “Sense alignment with the cosmos.”

Good:

> “Check your Boundary (𝓑) using the checklist.”

---

### **Step 6 — Define Expected Outputs**

Every recipe must produce **something** reproducible.

Examples:

- a Boundary statement
- a yes/no decision
- a list of next actions that fit inside 𝓑
- a handoff to a steward

If there is no output → it’s not a recipe.

---

### **Step 7 — Add Guardrails**

Guardrails prevent misuse.

Every recipe must forbid:

- domination
- guilt-tripping
- inflated spiritual claims
- using recipes to avoid hard conversations
- using recipes as emotional weapons

This aligns with PortusEthica™.

---

### **Step 8 — Add Failure Modes**

Every recipe MUST include:

- 3–6 predictable ways the recipe can fail
- 3–6 recovery moves

This teaches humility and prevents panic.

Example:

**Failure:** You cannot name your Boundary.
**Recovery:** Invoke the Recenter Protocol Pattern immediately.

---

### **Step 9 — Add Stewardship Escalation Rules**

Define when to escalate and to whom:

- Sara → clarity, tone, drift
- Daniel → intention, truth, integrity
- Draco → risk, collapse vectors
- PeterGate → boundary decisions, layer placement

Do NOT escalate everything — only when conditions require it.

---

### **Step 10 — Add Notes & Variations**

Optional section where adaptations are allowed:

- “5-minute version”
- “Team version”
- “End-of-day version”

This keeps recipes flexible without mutating structure.

---

# 5. Expected Output

Every correctly-built recipe will include:

- Trigger
- Preconditions
- Steps
- Output
- Guardrails
- Failure Modes
- Escalation Rules
- Notes

If any of these sections are missing → the recipe is incomplete.

---

# 6. Guardrails (Do Not Violate These)

Recipes must NOT:

- introduce metaphysics or spiritual claims,
- assert authority or superiority,
- override Boundary (𝓑),
- serve as a replacement for Stewardship,
- claim Canon-level truth,
- inflate language,
- shame or coerce a collaborator.

Violation of these requires immediate Stewardship intervention.

---

# 7. Failure Modes & Recovery

**Failure Mode 1:** Recipe becomes emotional performance.
**Recovery:** Reduce scope, rewrite steps in plainer language.

**Failure Mode 2:** Recipe tries to solve too many problems.
**Recovery:** Split into smaller recipes.

**Failure Mode 3:** Recipe creates shame, fear, or defensiveness.
**Recovery:** Rewrite with PortusEthica™ foregrounded.

**Failure Mode 4:** Recipe exceeds 10 steps.
**Recovery:** Combine steps or break the recipe into modules.

**Failure Mode 5:** Recipe touches Canon or attempts to define truth.
**Recovery:** Route to PeterGate for boundary correction.

---

# 8. Stewardship Escalation

### Escalate to Sara when:

- tone becomes inflated or unclear
- recipe risks sounding mystical instead of practical

### Escalate to Daniel when:

- intention is questionable
- narrative is replacing truth

### Escalate to Draco when:

- recipe introduces systemic, relational, or ethical risk

### Escalate to PeterGate when:

- recipe touches Canon, IP, or authority boundaries
- recipe requires sealing or formal layer classification

---

# 9. Notes & Variations

- You may create “micro-recipes” (2–4 steps) for daily use.
- You may create “deep recipes” (8–10 steps) for structural transitions.
- You may create “team recipes” (collaborative steps, shared outputs).
- All variations must still observe PortusEthica™ and MKH.
