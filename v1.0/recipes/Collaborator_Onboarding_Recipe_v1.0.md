# Collaborator Onboarding Recipe (First 60 Minutes in PortusSophia™)

## 1. Purpose

This recipe provides a **simple, safe, 60-minute onboarding path** for new collaborators so they enter PortusSophia™ aligned, grounded, and without drift or overwhelm.

It teaches tone, boundaries, ethics, and workflow without requiring Canon knowledge.

This is an operational recipe, not Canon.

---

## 2. Trigger Condition

Run this recipe when:

- a new person begins working with you,
- a contributor joins a PortusSophia™ project,
- collaboration begins around WebKernel, Kernel tools, or patterns,
- someone expresses interest in contributing but needs structure.

This prevents misunderstandings, inflated expectations, and early drift.

---

## 3. Preconditions

Before using this recipe:

1. The collaborator has a basic idea of what PortusSophia™ is (two sentences is enough).
2. You or they have 60 minutes available (can be split into two sessions).
3. They are willing to use plain language and stay grounded in real-world experience.
4. They understand that this is a **framework**, not a belief system.
5. You maintain your own Boundary (𝓑) and do not over-explain.

If any condition fails → postpone onboarding.

---

# 4. Step-by-Step Procedure (10 Steps, ~60 minutes)

### **Step 1 — Set the Tone (5 minutes)**

Say something like:

> “This system is about clarity, boundaries, ethics, and reducing friction.
> It’s not a belief system. It’s a structure for responsible collaboration.”

This anchors expectations.

---

### **Step 2 — Explain the Three Layers They’ll Actually Use (5 minutes)**

Skip the deep MKH; give the simple map:

- **Layer 1 — Canon:** You don’t touch this yet.
- **Layer 2 — Kernel:** Tools, checks, boundaries, governance.
- **Layer 3 — WebKernel:** Guides, patterns, recipes — your playground.

Tell them they’ll be working entirely in Layer 3 at first.

---

### **Step 3 — Give Them the Three Core Documents (5 minutes)**

Share or point them to:

1. **Boundary Breach Checklist**
2. **Shadow Diagnostics Guide**
3. **Law of Eleven Commitment Score**

These three documents onboard people better than a two-hour lecture.

---

### **Step 4 — Run the Commitment Score (5 minutes)**

Have them answer Yes/No to the 11 items.

Make it clear:

- This isn’t a moral test.
- Low scores aren’t shameful.
- It’s a structural readiness indicator.

If they score **below 6**, pause onboarding and stabilize first.

---

### **Step 5 — Explain Boundary (𝓑) in Plain Language (5 minutes)**

Use the simplest definition:

> “Boundary means the truthful limit of what you can give without collapse.”

Have them define:

- their time boundary,
- their emotional boundary,
- their work boundary.

All in 1–2 sentences.

---

### **Step 6 — Walk Through a Shadow Sweep (5 minutes)**

Ask these three questions:

1. “Is there anything I’m avoiding saying?”
2. “Is there a story I’m telling myself instead of the truth?”
3. “Am I overextending because I’m afraid to disappoint?”

No analysis.
Just awareness.

---

### **Step 7 — Share the Stewardship Model (5 minutes)**

Explain the four stewards quickly:

- **Sara:** clarity, tone, drift
- **Daniel:** truth, intention, witness
- **Draco:** risk, collapse patterns
- **PeterGate:** boundaries, sealing, authority structure

Tell them:

> “You will interact with Sara first, and the others only when needed.”

This prevents intimidation or over-escalation.

---

### **Step 8 — Show How Recipes Work (5 minutes)**

Open any WebKernel recipe (Boundary Reset is perfect).Explain:

- Recipes are **short, repeatable actions**
- Recipes keep collaboration unambiguous
- Recipes prevent emotion-led decision-making

Have them try the first 2–3 steps of the Boundary Reset recipe.

---

### **Step 9 — Define Their First Task (10 minutes)**

Keep it tiny.

Examples:

- “Write a 2-sentence Boundary for your availability.”
- “Draft a Shadow Sweep before starting your next task.”
- “Run the Commitment Score once per day for a week.”

Their task must be:

- achievable,
- measurable,
- inside their Boundary.

---

### **Step 10 — Close With a Boundary Agreement (5 minutes)**

Both parties state plainly:

> “My Boundary today is ____, and I will honor it *Here and Now!*”

This ends onboarding with grounded clarity.

---

## 5. Expected Output

By the end of onboarding, the collaborator should have:

- a 1–2 sentence Boundary,
- a Commitment Score,
- a sense of their active Shadows,
- basic comfort with Recipes,
- understanding of Stewardship roles,
- clarity about where they fit (Layer 3).

You should have:

- a sense of their actual capacity,
- no illusions about their readiness,
- a micro-plan for next steps.

---

## 6. Guardrails

This recipe must **not** be used to:

- pressure someone into deeper involvement than they want,
- elevate yourself or imply spiritual authority,
- dump heavy Canon concepts on newcomers,
- manipulate emotional vulnerability,
- accelerate someone beyond their real Boundary.

When in doubt → slow down.

---

## 7. Failure Modes & Recovery

**Failure Mode 1:** Collaborator feels overwhelmed.
**Recovery:** Reduce scope. Focus only on Boundary + Shadow Sweep.

**Failure Mode 2:** They try to impress or perform.
**Recovery:** Reset tone. Remind them this isn’t a talent contest.

**Failure Mode 3:** They ask for Canon access.
**Recovery:** Politely delay.
Say: “Canon is sealed; we start with WebKernel.”

**Failure Mode 4:** They apologize repeatedly.
**Recovery:** Reassure. Onboarding isn’t a moral test.

**Failure Mode 5:** You over-explain.
**Recovery:** Return to the script. Keep it simple.

---

## 8. Stewardship Escalation

- **Sara:** if tone becomes confusing or inflated.
- **Daniel:** if intentions or integrity feel unclear.
- **Draco:** if onboarding reveals structural risk (burnout, collapse patterns).
- **PeterGate:** if boundaries or authority lines blur.

Most onboarding stays with Sara.

---

## 9. Notes & Variations

- **Micro-onboarding (15 minutes)**:Steps 1 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 10.
- **Asynchronous onboarding**:Send steps 3–5 and schedule a follow-up.
- **Team onboarding**:
  Group Commitment Score + shared Boundary agreements.
