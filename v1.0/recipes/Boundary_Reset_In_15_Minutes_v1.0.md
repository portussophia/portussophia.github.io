# Boundary Reset in 15 Minutes (Rapid 𝓑 Stabilization Recipe)

## 1. Purpose

This recipe restores Boundary (𝓑) stability when friction spikes, overwhelm increases, or decisions start feeling rushed or emotionally loaded. It delivers a fast, concrete reset in 15 minutes.

This is an operational recipe, not Canon.

---

## 2. Trigger Condition

Run this recipe when:

- you feel scattered, overloaded, or emotionally compressed,
- multiple tasks or people are pulling you at once,
- you feel obligated beyond your real capacity,
- conversations begin showing strain,
- you sense you’re operating outside your Boundary (𝓑).

If you aren’t sure whether to run it — run it.

---

## 3. Preconditions

Before starting:

1. You have 15 minutes of privacy, or at least quiet.
2. You are not in active crisis (if you are, pause everything and secure safety first).
3. You are willing to be honest with yourself.
4. You have a place to write (paper, notes, file, anything).

If any of these fail, you cannot complete the reset. Try again later.

---

## 4. Step-by-Step (10 Steps, 15 Minutes)

### **Step 1 — Sit down. Breathe normally. (30 seconds)**

No deep breathing. No rituals.
Just sit. Let the system settle enough to think clearly.

---

### **Step 2 — Write one sentence: “What hurts?” (1 minute)**

Not paragraphs.
Just **one sentence** describing the pain point.

Example:

> “I feel pulled in ten directions and I’m losing track of myself.”

If the sentence feels dramatic or vague, restart.

---

### **Step 3 — Write one sentence: “What is the immediate problem?” (1 minute)**

This must be structural, not emotional.

Examples:

- “I said yes to too much.”
- “I don’t have clarity on what’s expected.”
- “I’m tired and pretending I’m not.”

If you can’t name it → proceed anyway (it will surface in later steps).

---

### **Step 4 — Check 𝓔_Tone (Emotional Load) (1 minute)**

Ask three questions:

1. Am I feeling rushed or cornered?
2. Do I feel resentment creeping in?
3. Do I feel guilt or pressure to “push through”?

If **YES** to 2 or more → your tone is distorted.
No shame. Just note it and continue.

---

### **Step 5 — Check for Boundary Breach (2 minutes)**

Ask:

1. “Did I agree to something beyond my real capacity?”
2. “Is someone waiting on me who does not know my limit?”
3. “Am I emotionally overextended?”

If **YES** to any → Boundary breach confirmed.

---

### **Step 6 — Define your Immediate Boundary (𝓑) (3 minutes)**

Write the smallest truthful Boundary you can hold for the next 24–72 hours:

Examples:

- “I can only handle two priorities today.”
- “I need 3 hours alone to finish this.”
- “I cannot commit to a timeline until I rest tonight.”

If this feels embarrassing → congratulations, that’s the real one.

---

### **Step 7 — Price the cost of 𝓑 (2 minutes)**

Answer:

- “What does it cost me to honor this?”
- “What does it cost others if I lie about my capacity?”

This removes the illusion that pretending has no cost.

---

### **Step 8 — Select the Next Action (1 minute)**

Choose **one** of these:

- Proceed with clarity (if stable)
- Reduce scope
- Delay responsibly
- Renegotiate
- Request Stewardship
- Invoke a longer Recenter Protocol (if boundary collapse is severe)

Only one.
Multiple actions = drift.

---

### **Step 9 — Communicate or Log the Boundary (2 minutes)**

Either:

- Tell the relevant person(s) the truth plainly, **or**
- Log the Boundary in your personal system if no communication is needed.

Use simple language:

> “I can give you an update tonight, not right now.”

> “I need until tomorrow morning for clarity.”

> “I said yes too fast — I need to adjust.”

No drama. No performance.

---

### **Step 10 — Close with one sentence (30 seconds)**

Write:

> “My Boundary is [X], and I can honor it *Here and Now!*”

This locks the reset.

---

## 5. Expected Output

By the end, you MUST have:

- one sentence naming the pain point,
- one sentence naming the structural problem,
- a clear 𝓑 for the next 24–72 hours,
- a selected action,
- a communication or log entry,
- a Boundary sentence to anchor the reset.

If any item is missing → the reset is incomplete.

---

## 6. Guardrails

- Do not use this recipe to withdraw from people emotionally.
- Do not use it to avoid responsibility indefinitely.
- Do not weaponize 𝓑 (“My boundary says you have to wait.”).
- Do not run it while actively overwhelmed — stabilize first.
- Do not treat this as Canon — it is operational, not doctrinal.

---

## 7. Failure Modes & Recovery

**Failure Mode 1:** You can't name the pain point in one sentence.
**Recovery:** Write three sentences. Shorten later.

**Failure Mode 2:** You feel shame naming your Boundary.
**Recovery:** Say it anyway. Shame ≠ truth.

**Failure Mode 3:** You pick multiple actions.
**Recovery:** Circle one. Cross out the others.

**Failure Mode 4:** You avoid communicating the Boundary.
**Recovery:** Communicate a micro-version (“I need a little time — will update soon.”).

**Failure Mode 5:** Emotional tone spikes midway.
**Recovery:** Pause for 2 minutes. Resume at Step 4.

---

## 8. Stewardship Escalation

Escalate to:

- **Sara** if language feels inflated, unclear, or dramatic.
- **Daniel** if truth feels muddy or integrity feels compromised.
- **Draco** if repeating this recipe reveals persistent collapse patterns.
- **PeterGate** if you suspect this Boundary interacts with Governance, IP, or Canon.

---

## 9. Notes & Variations

- **Micro-Version (3 minutes):**Steps 2 → 6 → 10 only.
- **Deep-Version (30 minutes):**Combine with Recenter Protocol Pattern for multi-day stabilization.
- **Team Version:**
  Run steps 2–8 together before a stressful meeting or decision.
