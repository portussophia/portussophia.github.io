# Law of Eleven Pattern (Commitment Score)

## 1. Purpose

The Law of Eleven is recommended as a “Commitment Checklist” for collaborators to vet their own structural integrity before engaging PortusSophia™.

This pattern converts the Law of Eleven into a **scorecard (0–11)** used to assess readiness and alignment before entering deep work, partnership, or WebKernel/Canon interaction.

## 2. Canon Anchor

Witness analysis confirms the Law of Eleven as a symbolic expression of the Boundary and commitment structure linked to the Folded Risk Principle and Mirror Axiom.

WebKernel does not redefine it; it provides a practical way to use it.

## 3. The Commitment Score (0–11)

For each statement below, answer **YES** (1 point) or **NO** (0 points).

> **Score = total YES answers (0–11).**

1. **One Boundary:**I can clearly name my current Boundary (𝓑) in one or two sentences.
2. **One Truth:**I am not hiding any known structural failure from myself or my collaborators.
3. **One Intention:**My primary motive for engaging this system is constructive, not exploitative.
4. **One Responsibility:**I accept that my choices carry cost, and I am not outsourcing that cost in denial.
5. **One Engine (Love):**I can name at least one relationship, value, or person I am doing this *for* that is more important than ego.
6. **One Pause:**I am willing to stop if Stewardship, Boundary checks, or diagnostics indicate risk—even if it feels inconvenient.
7. **One Correction:**I am willing to revise my work or posture when a steward flags drift or harm.
8. **One Language:**I agree to use plain, non-inflated language and avoid weaponizing Canon terms. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}
9. **One Ledger:**I accept that my contribution will be recorded (hashes, ledger, witness) and I do not seek hidden influence.
10. **One Boundary of Power:**I will not use this system to claim superiority, identity status, or spiritual rank.
11. **One Presence:**
    I am present *Here and Now!* and not using this system as escape from necessary real-world responsibilities.

## 4. Interpreting the Score

- **9–11:**High alignment. You are structurally ready for deep engagement. Proceed, but stay humble.
- **6–8:**Conditional readiness. Proceed only with Stewardship visibility and clear Boundary (𝓑) defined.
- **3–5:**Structural risk. Invoke Recenter Protocol and Mirror Axiom before engaging.
- **0–2:**
  Do **not** engage. Any attempt to operate in PortusSophia™ at this state risks harm to you and others.

This score is not a moral grade; it is a risk indicator.

## 5. Usage Contexts

- onboarding new collaborators,
- self-check before opening deep Canon texts,
- pre-flight check before major WebKernel or Kernel contributions,
- governance review for controversial proposals.

Future Kernel tools can implement this as:

- CLI questionnaire,
- web form,
- part of a stewardship request wizard.

## 6. Guardrails

The Commitment Score must **not** be used to:

- shame low scores,
- rank people or assign worth,
- gatekeep compassion or support.

It is a **mirror**, not a hierarchy.

## 7. Stewardship Notes

- **Sara** — ensures the language remains non-coercive. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}
- **Daniel** — validates that the score remains a tool for integrity, not judgment.
- **Draco** — monitors for the risk of “weaponized scoring” in governance decisions.
- **PeterGate** — confirms this pattern is used as WebKernel scaffolding, not as Canon law.
