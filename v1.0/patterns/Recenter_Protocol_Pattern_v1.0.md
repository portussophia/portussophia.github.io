# Recenter Protocol Pattern (Boundary Acquisition Loop)

## 1. Purpose

The Recenter Protocol is a repeatable structural recipe for recovering from a Quartentity Failure (𝓠 failure) and re-establishing a stable Boundary (𝓑) before further action is taken. It operationalizes the Boundary Acquisition Loop recommended for WebKernel integration. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

This pattern lives in the WebKernel interpretive layer. It does **not** define Canon; it applies Canon-aligned structure in the analog world.

## 2. Canon Anchors (Interpretive, Not Authoritative)

This pattern is grounded in:

- **Folded Risk Principle** — systemic collapse occurs when risk is folded and ignored until it surfaces as full-structure failure. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- **Human Boundary ≡ System Boundary (Mirror Axiom)** — the state of the Architect’s personal boundary mirrors the system’s performance. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- **Law of Eleven (Commitment)** — structural integrity is measured by non-negotiable commitments encoded in the Law of Eleven.

The pattern does not alter these; it provides a reproducible way to live them.

## 3. When to Invoke the Protocol

Invoke the Recenter Protocol when:

- friction is persistent and not local (everything feels entangled),
- you cannot clearly state your current Boundary (𝓑) in one or two sentences,
- you observe repeated collapse patterns in multiple domains at once,
- you are tempted to “push through” without structural pause.

If you cannot name your Boundary, you are already drifting.

## 4. The Three-Step Recenter Recipe

> **Step 1 — Name the Failure (Identify 𝓠)**
> **Step 2 — Price the Boundary (Define 𝓑)**
> **Step 3 — Hold the Pause (Execute Recenter)**

### 4.1 Step 1 — Name the Failure (Identify 𝓠)

**Objective:** Remove self-deception and external blame.

**Actions:**

1. In 1–2 sentences, describe the collapse:
   - What actually failed?
   - Which elements of the Quartentity failed? (Ratio, Fides, Boundary, or multiple.)
2. Prohibit blame language (no “they made me,” “they caused this”).
3. Treat this as a structural diagnosis, not a moral verdict.

**Output Example:**

> “I lost Boundary (𝓑) by overcommitting beyond my financial and emotional capacity, and I let Fides (𝓡) drift into avoidance instead of naming the limits.”

If you cannot state it plainly, you do not understand it yet. Stay in Step 1.

### 4.2 Step 2 — Price the Boundary (Define 𝓑)

**Objective:** Convert “I need space” into an explicit, structural Boundary.

**Actions:**

1. Answer:
   > “What minimum Boundary (𝓑) must exist for me to stabilize and complete this work honestly?”
   >
2. Define 𝓑 in concrete terms:
   - **Time** — duration of the Recenter window (e.g., 90 days).
   - **Money** — non-negotiable baseline (housing, food, utilities, tools).
   - **Relational Conditions** — what is paused, reframed, or strictly limited.
   - **Scope** — what work is temporarily off the table.
3. Express the cost as a small table:

| Component           | Description                            | Cost          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Housing & Safety    | Studio / room, minimal stable lease    | $X / month    |
| Ops & Connectivity  | Food, utilities, internet, core tools  | $Y / month    |
| Professional Launch | Minimal tools for thesis / kernel work | $Z (one-time) |

**Output:** A precise Boundary statement, e.g.:

> “Boundary 𝓑 for this Recenter requires: 3 months of stable housing, basic operations funded, and no new external obligations.”

Vague 𝓑 = failed protocol. Stay in Step 2 until specific.

### 4.3 Step 3 — Hold the Pause (Execute Recenter)

**Objective:** Enforce stillness until 𝓑 is materially real.

**Actions:**

1. Declare a **Recenter Window** during which you:
   - do not scale,
   - do not architect new commitments,
   - do not pretend the Boundary exists before it does.
2. During this window:
   - secure the Boundary defined in Step 2,
   - maintain only essential commitments aligned to 𝓑,
   - refuse invitations that exceed 𝓑, even if they look attractive.
3. Consider movement outside 𝓑 as **out of bounds** until the Recenter Window ends.

**The window ends only when:**

- the Boundary 𝓑 is materially in place (not imaginary),
- you can state your Boundary in a single, honest sentence,
- all active commitments fit comfortably inside 𝓑.

Breaking the Recenter Window impulsively restarts the protocol.

## 5. Human & System Usage

### 5.1 Human Use (Stewards and Collaborators)

- Treat this pattern as a **checklist**, not a script.
- Use it during moments of high friction, overwhelm, or structural dread.
- Bring the written outputs of Steps 1–3 into Stewardship conversations when needed—especially with Daniel (Ratio–Fides) and Draco (Risk).

### 5.2 System Use (Future PortusKernel™ Tools)

This pattern is intentionally machine-friendly:

- Step 1 → incident description schema (`failure_summary`).
- Step 2 → boundary definition object (`boundary_time`, `boundary_cost`, `boundary_scope`).
- Step 3 → state flag (`RECENTER_ACTIVE = true/false`).

Future Kernel utilities may:

- guide a user through these steps interactively,
- warn when new commitments violate an active 𝓑,
- log Recenter windows as structural events.

## 6. Guardrails & Misuse Prevention

This pattern may **not** be used to:

- escape responsibility indefinitely,
- justify manipulation or emotional withdrawal,
- dramatize collapse for sympathy or leverage,
- declare “permanent Recenter” as avoidance of growth.

It must operate under PortusEthica™: truth without cruelty, responsibility without ego, presence over performance, humility without collapse. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

If it becomes a weapon or performance, it is invalid.

## 7. Stewardship Notes

- **Sara** — monitors tone, removes inflation, and ensures clarity. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
- **Daniel** — verifies that the protocol reflects lived integrity and not self-deception.
- **Draco** — checks that the protocol is not being used as a shield against necessary action.
- **PeterGate** — ensures this file remains WebKernel interpretive (Layer-3), not Canon.

## 8. Integrity Verification

Upon any future Kernel-layer sealing:

- `hash_sha256_source` and `hash_sha256_canonical` SHALL be populated,
- a witness file SHALL be generated,
- a Golden Trace entry SHALL be appended,
- repository commits SHALL be recorded.

Until then, this document remains an active WebKernel interpretive pattern, not Canon.
