# Christian Thesis Bridge Index

## Purpose

This index serves as a **WebKernel Layer-3 reference point** for the Christian Thesis — a personal theological reflection exploring faith, restoration, and the relationship between Christian theology and PortusSophia™ structural frameworks.

**Classification:** This is **not Canon**. It is a personal faith testimony by the Founder, offered as an optional interpretive bridge for those interested in interfaith dialogue and convergence exploration.

## Scope

The Christian Thesis addresses:

- Grace as the foundation of transformation
- The pattern of descent and humility in biblical narrative
- Love as the engine of becoming
- The Cross as the intersection of love, truth, and responsibility
- Presence (*"Here and Now!"*) in Christian theology
- Faith and reason as complementary systems
- Restoration as the long road home

**Boundaries:**

- Does **not** claim PortusSophia™ is Christian theology
- Does **not** require adherence to Christian faith for PortusSophia™ engagement
- Does **not** impose religious obligation on collaborators
- **Does** acknowledge the Founder's Christian faith as a formative influence
- **Does** offer a bridge for those exploring convergence between structural ethics and faith traditions

## Public Reflection (Non-Canonical)

The full Christian Thesis and related materials are available as **public-facing personal testimony** at:

**Public Website Path:** `/site-public/faith-reflection/`

### Available Documents:

## WebKernel Layer-3 Classification

**Why This is WebKernel, Not Canon:**

- Canon defines **structural invariants** (ethics, ontology, epistemology)
- WebKernel provides **interpretive scaffolding** (applications, bridges, recipes)
- The Christian Thesis is an **interpretive bridge** showing how one individual's faith tradition relates to Canon structures

**MKH Layer:** Layer-3 (Kernel/Interpretive)
**Dependency:** Inherits from Canon (PS-CAN-100 PortusEthica™, PS-CAN-130 PortusNunc™) but does not alter or extend it

## Privacy & Sanitization Notes

All versions of the Christian Thesis have been **sanitized for privacy protection:**

- No personal names
- No identifying biographical details
- No location-specific information
- Sentiment and gratitude preserved
- Theological content intact

**Dedication Principle:** *"Love is something you protect, not publish."*

## Relationship to Canon

| Canon Element | Thesis Connection |
|---------------|-------------------|
| **PortusEthica™** (PS-CAN-100) | Love as ethical foundation; responsibility without coercion |
| **PortusStructura™** (PS-CAN-110) | Descent as structural necessity; humility as truth-telling |
| **PortusLumen™** (PS-CAN-120) | Faith and reason as complementary; no sacred/secular divide |
| **PortusNunc™** (PS-CAN-130) | Presence (*"Here and Now!"*) as the moment where grace works |
| **PortusNexus™** (PS-CAN-140) | Restoration as relational integration; covenant as structure |

**Theological Additions (Not Canon):**

- Grace as unmerited favor
- The Cross as sacrificial love model
- Redemption as ongoing process
- Biblical descent narratives (Jonah, David, Peter)

These theological concepts **inform the Founder's perspective** but are **not required for PortusSophia™ engagement**.

## Usage Guidelines

**This thesis may be used:**

- As personal reflection material
- In interfaith dialogue contexts
- To understand the Founder's ethical formation
- To explore convergence between structural ethics and Christian theology

**This thesis may NOT be used:**

- As PortusSophia™ Canon
- As required reading for collaborators
- As theological doctrine
- To impose religious obligation
- To claim PortusSophia™ is "Christian philosophy"

## Stewardship Notes

**Sara (Harmonia):** Ensure thesis remains humble, non-coercive, and accessible
**Daniel (Ratio–Fides):** Verify theological sincerity and lived-truth grounding
**Draco (Risk):** Monitor for spiritual inflation or gatekeeping misuse
**LOGOS:** Confirm WebKernel Layer-3 classification maintained
**PeterGate:** Enforce privacy protection and boundary integrity
