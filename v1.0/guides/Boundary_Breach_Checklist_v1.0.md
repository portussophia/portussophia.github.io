# Boundary Breach Checklist (𝓑 & 𝓔_Tone Diagnostic)

## 1. Purpose

This guide implements the recommended “Boundary Breach Checklist” for collaborators who experience high friction (𝓔_Tone) and need a simple way to trace the problem back to Boundary (𝓑) and Resonance (𝓡).

It is a quick WebKernel diagnostic, not a full protocol.

## 2. When to Use

Use this checklist when any of the following are true:

- you feel persistent frustration, overwhelm, or resentment around the work,
- conversations feel defensive or tense,
- tasks multiply faster than they resolve,
- collaborators seem confused about scope or expectations.

## 3. Step 1 — Check 𝓔_Tone (Emotional Friction)

Answer YES/NO:

1. Am I feeling rushed or cornered?
2. Do I feel I “owe” more than I can realistically give?
3. Am I mentally rehearsing arguments or defenses?
4. Do I feel shame, fear, or anger when I think about this work?

If **2 or more** answers are YES, 𝓔_Tone is high.

High 𝓔_Tone is a **signal**, not a failure.

## 4. Step 2 — Check 𝓑 (Boundary)

Ask:

1. Have I explicitly defined my Boundary (time, money, scope, relationships) for this work?
2. Have I said “yes” to anything that violates that Boundary?
3. Are there people depending on me who do not know my actual limits?
4. Would I be embarrassed to say my real limits out loud?

If **any** answer is YES, assume a Boundary breach.

## 5. Step 3 — Check 𝓡 (Resonance / Fides)

Ask:

1. Does this work still align with my deepest “why,” or am I just going through motions?
2. Am I avoiding an honest conversation about misalignment?
3. Am I using PortusSophia™ language to justify something that doesn’t feel right?

If **any** answer is YES, 𝓡 is drifting.

## 6. Step 4 — Decide the Next Move

Based on the checks:

- **High 𝓔_Tone + Breached 𝓑:**→ Invoke Recenter Protocol Pattern. :contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}
- **Stable 𝓑 + Drifting 𝓡:**→ Schedule a Stewardship conversation (Daniel + Sara) to clarify alignment.
- **High 𝓔_Tone + unclear 𝓑 + unclear 𝓡:**
  → Stop committing to new work, write a one-page Recenter declaration.

## 7. Steward & Tool Integration

- Sara can include this checklist in onboarding and guidance docs.
- PortusKernel™ tools can implement it as a lightweight questionnaire.
- Draco can use aggregated Boundary Breach signals to identify systemic risk patterns.
