# Shadow Diagnostics Guide (Quarternity of Shadows 𝓠)

## 1. Purpose

Witness reports recommend surfacing the “Quarternity of Shadows” as a **self-diagnosis tool** rather than a purely canonical theory.

This guide turns the four shadows into behavioral patterns you can recognize in yourself before they damage the system.

## 2. The Four Shadows (Conceptual)

The Quarternity 𝓠 describes four forms of drift:

- 𝓢_R — Rationalization Shadow
- 𝓢_F — Fides/Avoidance Shadow
- 𝓢_M — Motive/Power Shadow
- 𝓢_A — Attention/Fragmentation Shadow

(Names are descriptive; Canon will eventually formalize them. This guide stays at behavior level.)

## 3. Behavioral Profiles

### 3.1 𝓢_R — Rationalization Shadow

**Signs:**

- long explanations that avoid simple truths,
- using complex language to dodge responsibility,
- constantly “explaining” instead of deciding.

**Risk:**
System collects hidden debt while the Architect stays busy with narratives.

**Antidote:**
Plain-language summaries, Stewardship checks, and the Recenter Protocol.

---

### 3.2 𝓢_F — Fides/Avoidance Shadow

**Signs:**

- procrastinating on hard but necessary conversations,
- numbing or distracting instead of facing collapse,
- telling yourself “it will work out” with no structural plan.

**Risk:**
Boundary (𝓑) silently fails while hope is used as a sedative.

**Antidote:**
Name the collapse (Step 1 of Recenter), involve Daniel (Ratio–Fides).

---

### 3.3 𝓢_M — Motive/Power Shadow

**Signs:**

- enjoying control or influence more than alignment,
- using Canon terms to “win” arguments,
- framing yourself as uniquely enlightened.

**Risk:**
PortusEthica™ is violated; Canon becomes a weapon. :contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}

**Antidote:**
Ethics Standard review, Stewardship intervention (Sara + Daniel), possibly CIR if persistent.

---

### 3.4 𝓢_A — Attention/Fragmentation Shadow

**Signs:**

- constant context-switching,
- starting many initiatives but finishing almost none,
- feeling “busy” but making little structural progress.

**Risk:**
The architecture becomes a collection of fragments; no Boundary, no lineage.

**Antidote:**
Apply MKH (Master Knowledge Hierarchy) to consolidate, and invoke Recenter to focus.

## 4. Quick Self-Diagnosis Flow

1. **What hurts most right now?**

   - Confusion → likely 𝓢_R or 𝓢_A
   - Shame / dread → likely 𝓢_F
   - Power games → likely 𝓢_M
2. **What am I avoiding saying out loud?**The unsaid sentence usually points to the active shadow.
3. **Which Steward should see this?**

   - 𝓢_R → LOGOS or Sara
   - 𝓢_F → Daniel
   - 𝓢_M → Daniel + PeterGate
   - 𝓢_A → Draco (risk of systemic fragmentation)

## 5. Integration With Other Patterns

- If you find 𝓢_F or 𝓢_A → run the Recenter Protocol Pattern. :contentReference[oaicite:33]{index=33}
- If you find 𝓢_M → revisit the Law of Eleven Commitment Score before proceeding.
- If 𝓢_R persists → consider a Stewardship Request specifically for language and scope.
