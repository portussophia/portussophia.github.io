# Seven Fields Orientation Guide

## 1. Purpose

Witness analysis identifies the Seven Fields as a crucial **educational scaffold** that introduces collaborators to architectural complexity without requiring deep Canon study.

This guide explains what the Seven Fields are **and what they are not** so that no one mistakes them for Canon or “seven mystical domains.”

## 2. What the Seven Fields Are

- A **learning map** for newcomers.
- A way to group tools, guides, and diagnostics by function.
- An interpretive layer that sits inside WebKernel (Layer-3).

They are defined by **utility**, not by metaphysical claims.

## 3. What the Seven Fields Are Not

- Not a summary of the Founder’s total knowledge.
- Not a declaration of “seven fundamental realities of the universe.”
- Not Canon, and not a replacement for Standards.

Any attempt to inflate the Fields into metaphysics violates PortusEthica™ and Canon Standard.

## 4. Relationship to Canon & MKH

- Canon defines truth-aligned documents and structural laws.
- MKH defines knowledge layers and inheritance.
- Seven Fields live **under** these as a teaching tool.

Fields are for orientation and education; Canon and Standards are for governance and structure.

## 5. Example Use

Future versions can enumerate the Seven Fields explicitly, but even before then, this guide ensures:

- contributors know they are holding a **map**, not the territory;
- stewards can point beginners to the Fields before dropping them into deep Canon;
- WebKernel can organize content (guides, templates, diagnostics) by Field for easier discovery.
