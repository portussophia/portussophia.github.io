# WebKernel Recipe Template (Operational Playbook)

## 1. Purpose

This template defines the standard format for **WebKernel recipes** — repeatable operational playbooks that turn PortusSophia™ principles into practical actions. Recipes help collaborators apply Boundary, Ethics, Stewardship, and Kernel logic without improvisation or drift.

It is a **Layer-3 WebKernel template**, not Canon.

## 2. How to Use This Template

- Duplicate this file when creating a new recipe.
- Replace bracketed fields `[ ... ]`.
- Keep language plain (UICF), ethical (PortusEthica™), and non-inflated.
- Recipes should be **10 steps or fewer** unless complexity demands otherwise.
- Every recipe MUST include:
  - a trigger condition,
  - a step-by-step sequence,
  - guardrails,
  - failure modes,
  - stewardship escalation paths.

# RECIPE NAME

`[e.g., “Boundary Reset in 15 Minutes”, “Shadow Sweep Before Decision-Making”, etc.]`

## 3. Trigger Condition

> When should this recipe be run?
> Examples:

- “When friction spikes unexpectedly during collaboration,”
- “Before making a commitment that affects more than one person,”
- “At the first sign of Shadow drift.”

`[Describe trigger here.]`

---

## 4. Preconditions

> What must already be true before beginning this recipe?

Examples:

- “You are not in immediate physical or emotional danger.”
- “You have 5–10 minutes of uninterrupted time.”
- “The relevant document or situation is open in front of you.”

`[List preconditions here.]`

---

## 5. Step-by-Step Procedure

> Keep steps clean, numbered, and action-oriented.

Example structure:

1. **Pause** for 20–60 seconds and breathe normally.
2. **Name the Problem** in one sentence.
3. **Identify Boundary Load** (time, money, emotional weight).
4. **Check 𝓑 vs 𝓔_Tone** using the Boundary Breach Checklist.
5. **Choose Action** (e.g., proceed, Recenter, request Stewardship).
6. **Record Outcome** in your notes or in the project file.

`[Insert your recipe steps here.]`

---

## 6. Expected Output

> What should exist by the end of the recipe?

Examples:

- “A one-sentence Boundary statement.”
- “A list of next actions limited to what fits inside 𝓑.”
- “A note to Sara/Ratios/Draco for follow-up.”

`[Define outputs here.]`

---

## 7. Guardrails

> Prevent misuse, drift, or ethical violations.
> Align with PortusEthica™ and the Stewardship Model.

Examples:

- “This recipe must never be used to guilt or pressure another person.”
- “Do not use this recipe to avoid difficult conversations indefinitely.”
- “If the recipe increases shame or confusion, stop and request Stewardship.”

`[List guardrails here.]`

---

## 8. Failure Modes & Recovery

> Describe what can go wrong and how to recover.

Examples:

- **Failure:** You cannot name the Boundary (𝓑).**Recovery:** Invoke the Recenter Protocol Pattern.
- **Failure:** Emotional friction spikes during Step 4.**Recovery:** Pause, take a break, or route to Daniel (Ratio–Fides).
- **Failure:** The recipe becomes performative.
  **Recovery:** Stop. Reground in *Here and Now!* and restart later.

`[Describe failures + recoveries here.]`

---

## 9. Stewardship Escalation

Choose based on the recipe's theme:

- **Sara (Harmonia):**If clarity, tone, or interpretive drift appears.
- **Daniel (Ratio–Fides):**If intention, truth, or presence is uncertain.
- **Draco (Risk):**If the recipe reveals systemic or collapse-vector risks.
- **PeterGate:**
  If this recipe implies boundary moves or touches Governance/Canon.

`[Describe when escalation is required.]`

## 10. Notes & Variations

Use this section for optional variants, timing, or personal adaptations.

Examples:

- “5-minute version for daily work.”
- “Deep version for major relationships or life decisions.”
- “Team version for multi-person decisions.”
