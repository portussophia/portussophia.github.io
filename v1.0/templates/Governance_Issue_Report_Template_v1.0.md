# Governance Issue Report Template (GIR)

## 1. Purpose

The Governance Issue Report (GIR) provides a structured way to log **suspected governance violations, drift, or structural concerns** so stewards can act in alignment with the Governance Standard and Stewardship Model.

It is a WebKernel template used **before** triggering a Canon Integrity Review (CIR) or major intervention.

---

## 2. Reporter & Scope

**Reporter:**

- Name: `[Your Name]`
- Role: `[Founder / Steward / Collaborator / Observer]`
- Date (UTC): `[YYYY-MM-DD]`

**Issue Scope (check all that apply):**

- [ ] Canon (documents, structure, authority)
- [ ] Kernel (tools, automation, boundary logic) :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}
- [ ] Governance (roles, decisions, process)
- [ ] Ethics (PortusEthica™ violation) :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}
- [ ] IP / Trademarks (Portus-family marks misuse)
- [ ] Other: `[Describe]`

---

## 3. Issue Summary (Plain Language)

> In 3–6 sentences, describe **what you believe is wrong** and **why it matters**.

Prompt:

- What did you see or read?
- Which decision or artifact is involved?
- What is your best understanding of the risk or harm?

`[Issue summary here.]`

---

## 4. Evidence & References

List the relevant materials:

- Documents / UIDs:
  - `[PS-…]`
- Paths:
  - `[C:\workspace\PortusSophia\…]`
- Dates / Events:
  - `[e.g., “2025-11-29 — PS-CAN-140 sealing run”]`

If applicable, include short quotes (≤ 2–3 lines) rather than entire documents.

---

## 5. Suspected Standard(s) Impacted

Check any that may be impacted:

- [ ] PS-STD-000 — Standard of Standards
- [ ] PS-STD-001 — UICH (header compliance)
- [ ] PS-STD-002 — UIDS (identity & placement)
- [ ] PS-STD-003 — UICF (formatting & tone)
- [ ] PS-STD-004 — MKH (layering)
- [ ] PS-STD-010 — Stewardship Model :contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}
- [ ] PS-STD-020 — Canon Standard
- [ ] PS-STD-030 — Ethics Standard (PortusEthica™) :contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}
- [ ] PS-STD-040 — Kernel Standard :contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32}
- [ ] PS-STD-050 — IP Standard
- [ ] PS-STD-060 — Governance Standard

For each checked item, optionally add 1–2 lines:

`[Short explanation of how you think it may be impacted.]`

---

## 6. Risk Assessment (Reporter’s View)

This is your **best guess**; Draco will refine it.

- **Severity (impact if true):**

  - [ ] Low — localized friction
  - [ ] Medium — affects multiple artifacts / relationships
  - [ ] High — systemic risk / potential Canon or Governance fracture
- **Urgency (time sensitivity):**

  - [ ] Low — can wait for normal Stewardship cycles
  - [ ] Medium — should be reviewed in next Stewardship window
  - [ ] High — requires rapid attention

**Notes:**

`[Your reasoning here.]`

---

## 7. Ethical Considerations

> How might this issue impact people, not just structure?

Prompt:

- Who could be harmed or confused if this is not addressed?
- Does the issue allow domination, coercion, or inflation? :contentReference[oaicite:36]{index=36}
- Are there power dynamics to be mindful of?

`[Ethical reflection here.]`

---

## 8. Requested Stewardship Actions

Check what you are asking for:

- [ ] Sara — Clarify language / prevent interpretive drift :contentReference[oaicite:37]{index=37}
- [ ] Daniel — Provide Ratio–Fides witness on intent
- [ ] Draco — Perform risk analysis / collapse vector mapping
- [ ] PeterGate — Enforce boundary decision (block / delay / reclassify / retire)
- [ ] Consider Canon Integrity Review (CIR) if warranted

**If requesting CIR, explain why:**

`[Your reasoning here; keep it concrete.]`

---

## 9. Reporter Signature

> I submit this Governance Issue Report in good faith, seeking alignment rather than victory, and remaining open to correction.

- Signature: `[Name or handle]`
- Date: `[YYYY-MM-DD]`
