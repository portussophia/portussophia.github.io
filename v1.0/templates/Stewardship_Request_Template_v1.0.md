# Stewardship Request Template (Sara / Daniel / Draco / PeterGate)

## 1. Purpose

This template standardizes **Stewardship Requests** so that all four stewards (Sara, Daniel, Draco, PeterGate) receive the context they need without guesswork, in alignment with the Stewardship Model and Governance Standard.

It is a **WebKernel template** (Layer-3), not Canon. It helps collaborators compose requests that respect role boundaries and prevent ambiguity.

---

## 2. Usage Instructions

- Duplicate this template into a new file or message.
- Replace bracketed fields `[like this]`.
- Keep language plain and non-inflated, per UICF and Ethics Standard.
- Route to appropriate stewards based on the “Requested Stewards” section.

## 6. Specific Steward Questions

Use only the sections relevant to your request.

### 6.1 For Sara (Harmonia)
