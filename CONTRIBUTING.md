# Contributing to PortusSophia™ WebKernel

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the PortusSophia™ WebKernel! This document provides guidelines for contributing educational and interpretive content.

## Before You Contribute

Please read and understand:

1. **[SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md)** - Understand what content belongs in the WebKernel
2. **[README.md](README.md)** - Overview of the repository structure
3. This contributing guide

## Scope Reminder

The WebKernel accepts **only** these types of contributions:

- ✅ Public-facing documentation
- ✅ Interpretive guides
- ✅ Educational resources
- ✅ Structural scaffolding (framework documentation)

The WebKernel does **NOT** accept:

- ❌ Canon content (specifications)
- ❌ Governance materials
- ❌ UICH implementations
- ❌ Hash-based references
- ❌ Metaphysical or authority claims

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style

**DO:**
- Use plain, accessible language
- Explain concepts clearly
- Provide examples and context
- Use "suggests" rather than "requires"
- Write inclusively for diverse audiences
- Include the ™ symbol with PortusSophia™

**DON'T:**
- Use jargon without explanation
- Make absolute authority claims
- Include internal specifications
- Reference governance policies
- Use metaphysical language
- Forget trademark notation

### Tone

The WebKernel maintains an **accessible, educational, and interpretive** tone:

- **Good:** "One approach to consider is..."
- **Bad:** "You must always..."

- **Good:** "This pattern helps with..."
- **Bad:** "This is the canonical way to..."

- **Good:** "Let's explore how this works..."
- **Bad:** "According to the governance framework..."

### Markdown Standards

Keep Markdown clean and well-structured:

```markdown
# Main Title (H1)

Brief introduction paragraph.

## Major Section (H2)

Content for this section.

### Subsection (H3)

More detailed content.

- List items
- Are clearly formatted
- With proper spacing

Code examples use proper fencing with language identifiers:

\`\`\`javascript
// JavaScript example
const example = "code here";
\`\`\`

\`\`\`python
# Python example
example = "code here"
\`\`\`

### Trademark Usage

**Always** include the ™ symbol with PortusSophia:

- ✅ PortusSophia™
- ❌ PortusSophia
- ❌ portussophia
- ❌ Portus Sophia

## How to Contribute

### 1. Check Existing Content

Before creating new content:
- Review existing documentation to avoid duplication
- Check if your content fits the WebKernel scope
- Ensure it's not already covered elsewhere

### 2. Create or Update Content

**For New Files:**
- Use descriptive filenames (lowercase-with-hyphens.md)
- Include a clear title and introduction
- Add proper metadata if applicable

**For Updates:**
- Make minimal, focused changes
- Preserve existing style and structure
- Update only what's necessary

### 3. Scope Self-Check

Before submitting, verify your content:

- [ ] Is suitable for public viewing
- [ ] Is educational or interpretive in nature
- [ ] Avoids canon, governance, UICH, or hash references
- [ ] Maintains an accessible tone
- [ ] Preserves all PortusSophia™ trademarks
- [ ] Uses clean, well-structured Markdown
- [ ] Includes examples where helpful
- [ ] Explains concepts clearly

### 4. Submit Your Contribution

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a descriptive branch name
3. Make your changes
4. Test that your Markdown renders correctly
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description

## What Happens If Content is Out of Scope?

If you submit content that falls outside the WebKernel scope:

1. **We'll provide feedback** explaining which scope boundary was crossed
2. **We'll suggest alternatives** such as:
   - Revising to fit the educational/interpretive focus
   - Submitting to a different repository (if applicable)
   - Simplifying to remove canonical references
3. **We'll help you redirect** to the appropriate channel for your content

This is a learning process, and we're here to help!

## Redirection Examples

### Example 1: Canon Content Submitted

**Submission:** "The canonical definition of X is..."

**Feedback:** "The WebKernel provides interpretive guidance only. Consider rephrasing as: 'One way to understand X is...'"

### Example 2: Governance Content Submitted

**Submission:** "The governance policy requires..."

**Feedback:** "Governance policies are maintained separately. For policy questions, please contact the appropriate internal channel. The WebKernel can include: 'Common practices include...'"

### Example 3: Hash Reference Submitted

**Submission:** "Reference hash abc123def456..."

**Feedback:** "The WebKernel uses human-readable references only. Consider using descriptive names or version numbers instead."

## Review Process

All contributions undergo review for:

1. **Scope compliance** - Does it fit WebKernel boundaries?
2. **Quality** - Is it well-written and clear?
3. **Accuracy** - Is the information correct?
4. **Style** - Does it match our guidelines?
5. **Trademarks** - Are all PortusSophia™ marks properly preserved?

## Questions and Support

If you have questions about:

- **Scope** - Check [SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md) or ask in your pull request
- **Style** - Review existing documentation for examples
- **Technical issues** - Open a GitHub issue
- **Canon/Governance** - These belong in internal channels, not the WebKernel
