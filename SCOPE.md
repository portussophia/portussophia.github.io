# WebKernel Scope Definition

## Purpose

This document defines the boundaries and constraints for all content in the PortusSophia™ WebKernel. The WebKernel is a public-facing educational resource, and all content must adhere to these scope limitations.

## What IS in Scope

The PortusSophia™ WebKernel contains **only** the following types of content:

### 1. Public-Facing Documentation
- User guides and tutorials
- Getting started materials
- Overview documents
- Public API documentation
- FAQ sections
- Glossaries and terminology guides

### 2. Interpretive Guides
- Explanations of concepts and patterns
- Educational walkthroughs
- Context and background information
- Use case examples
- Best practice suggestions (not mandates)

### 3. Structural Scaffolding
- Framework documentation
- Architecture overviews (public-facing only)
- Integration guides
- Configuration examples
- Template structures

### 4. Educational Resources
- Learning pathways
- Tutorial series
- Conceptual explanations
- Illustrative examples
- Reference materials

## What is NOT in Scope

The following content types are **explicitly excluded** from the WebKernel:

### 1. Canon Content ❌
- Internal specifications
- Authoritative definitions
- Canonical references
- Implementation requirements
- Normative standards

**Why excluded:** Canon represents internal, authoritative specifications that are not suitable for public interpretation.

### 2. Governance Materials ❌
- Administrative policies
- Organizational procedures
- Decision-making frameworks
- Authority structures
- Compliance requirements

**Why excluded:** Governance is internal administrative content not intended for public distribution.

### 3. UICH (User Interface Component Hierarchy) ❌
- Specific UI implementations
- Component hierarchies
- Interface specifications
- Design system internals

**Why excluded:** UICH represents detailed implementation specifics that belong in technical repositories.

### 4. Hash-Based References ❌
- Cryptographic identifiers
- Hash-based versioning systems
- Content-addressed references
- Merkle structures

**Why excluded:** Hash references are technical implementation details not necessary for educational content.

### 5. Metaphysical or Authority Claims ❌
- Absolute truth statements
- Authority assertions
- Metaphysical frameworks
- Philosophical dogma

**Why excluded:** WebKernel maintains an accessible, educational tone without making authority claims.

## Content Redirection

If you encounter requests for out-of-scope content, use these redirections:

### For Canon Content
> **Note:** This WebKernel contains interpretive and educational content only. For canonical specifications, please refer to the appropriate internal documentation channels.

### For Governance Content
> **Note:** Governance and administrative policies are not part of the public WebKernel. For governance information, please contact the appropriate organizational channels.

### For UICH Content
> **Note:** User Interface Component Hierarchy implementations are maintained in technical repositories. This WebKernel provides conceptual guidance only.

### For Hash-Based References
> **Note:** This WebKernel uses human-readable references only. Technical implementation details including hash-based systems are maintained elsewhere.

## Content Quality Standards

All WebKernel content must meet these standards:

### Accessibility
- Written in plain language
- Avoids jargon where possible
- Defines technical terms when used
- Suitable for diverse audiences

### Educational Focus
- Teaches rather than prescribes
- Explains "why" not just "what"
- Provides context and examples
- Encourages understanding

### Interpretive Approach
- Offers perspective rather than absolutes
- Acknowledges multiple valid approaches
- Suggests rather than mandates
- Open to community input

### Clean Markdown
- Well-structured documents
- Consistent formatting
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Clear organization

### Trademark Preservation
- All instances of "PortusSophia" include ™ symbol
- Proper attribution maintained
- Trademark notice in footers
- Rights reserved statements

## Enforcement

Content that violates these scope boundaries should be:

1. **Identified** - Flag the out-of-scope content
2. **Documented** - Note what scope rule is violated
3. **Redirected** - Provide appropriate guidance
4. **Removed** - Delete or relocate the content as needed

## Review Process

All contributions to the WebKernel must be reviewed for scope compliance:

- ✅ **Pass** - Content is educational, public-facing, and interpretive
- ⚠️ **Revise** - Content needs adjustment to meet scope requirements
- ❌ **Reject** - Content belongs in a different repository

## Questions

If you're uncertain whether content belongs in the WebKernel, ask:

1. Is this content suitable for public viewing?
2. Is this content educational or interpretive in nature?
3. Does this content avoid canon, governance, UICH, or hash references?
4. Does this content maintain an accessible tone?
5. Are all PortusSophia™ trademarks properly preserved?

If you answer "yes" to all questions, the content is likely in scope.

## Updates to This Document

This scope definition may be updated as the WebKernel evolves. All changes should maintain the core principle: **WebKernel is for public, educational, interpretive content only.**
